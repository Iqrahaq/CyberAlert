> A Front-End GUI (Prototype) to visualise network information, provide potential cyber alerts and build reports for an organisation. 


## Usage

</p>

## Background

*During my Masters Year of University (5<sup>th</sup> Year), I was tasked with creating a Front-End GUI that was expected to:*

* Provide visual representation of network information.
* Provide 24/7/365 access.
* Allow multiple users access.
* Allow access anywhere.
* Generate Reports to capture instances of metrics.

## How it works

<p align="center">
  <img src="/img/GUIProcess.PNG" alt="Process"/>
</p>

**1. A CSV file that is constantly being updated is also constantly being read as the input data. <br/>**
**2. This input data is then processed through various HTML / CSS / JavaScript with a Python Framework (Django).<br/>**
**3. Once processed, visual representation is successfully achieved.<br/>**

## Further Details

### Project Scope

The main reason for this GUI was to achieve the following scope:

> Design a detection alarm system using ML for anomaly detection and port mirroring for flow-based traffic attached to a server to implement an accessible and efficient software.

### Aims & Objectives

*The aims and objectives that helped steer the GUI creation are as follows:*

#### Aims

* Design a detection system that processes datasets and implements accessible and efficient software for anomaly-based detection.
* Implement a Machine Learning (ML) detection system with Python to use port mirroring attached to a dedicated server to predict network cyber threats such as Botnets, Malware, Ransomware. 

#### Objectives

* **S**pecific: To create software that can accurately identify and alert a cyber-attack from port mirrored traffic.
* **M**easurable: A Gantt chart & Kanban Board to measure progress and stay on track to completion allowing distribution of workload amongst four group members. 
* **A**chievable: This group is comprised of individuals with prior knowledge in ML and Python programming. Furthermore, the group has completed three years of network modules. In addition, members also have experience in the area of penetration testing.
* **R**elevant: This project will provide an alarm system software deployable within an organisationâ€™s network. The software will perform automated detection and alert methods for organisations to act immediately.
* **T**imely: The goal is to complete software implementation early to improve and thoroughly test the product.
